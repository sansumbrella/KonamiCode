Makes it easy to add secret content to your site/game/whatever. Just add a KonamiLayer as a child and tell it what to do or where to find your extra content.

Use it like this:

//to call a function when the code is entered:
addChild( new KonamiLayer( functionName ) );

//to load in some outside content when the code is entered:
addChild( new KonamiLayer( "path/to/content" ) );

The KonamiLayer extends the built-in Loader class, so you can load any kind of visual content allowed by Flash (.swf, .jpg, .png, non-animated .gif)
